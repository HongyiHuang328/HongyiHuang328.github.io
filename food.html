            Welcome to this hidden page, which records my recommendations on restaurants (with reasonable prices) and special food in some cities that I explored or even lived in. Everything is based on my own opinion on food tasting, which means you may have different feelings.
        </p>

        <p>
Very first but important remark: Though (as a Chinese) I have extremely high standard of Chinese food, there are still some Chinese restaurants recommended in the guide for cities outside China. This does not mean they are still great in Chinese standard — literally very few Chinese restaurants overseas can survive in China.

        </p>

        <p>
I believe the guides will be helpful for most people (truly delicious food should be delicious for everyone), especially for Chinese who have similar taste for food as myself.

        </p>

        <p>
Due to my language ability, sometimes I find it struggled to express my own feelings properly in English. So you may find some paragraphs totally in Chinese in some guides. I expect there will be a lot (but not too many) when I write guides for Chinese cities in (hopefully near) future.

        </p>

        <p>
Most of the articles are joint with my love Bo Lan, who has better understanding on food than myself.

            A quick note: Some of the reviews can be found via my Google account "Hongyi Huang". Additionally, Bo and I gave Caffé Pedrocchi in Padova 1-star reviews based on our real experience there,
            which seem to be quickly reported by the owners and removed from Google. They seem to do the same things to other low-star reviews, which is disgusting.
            I expect their real rating is about 3. Please avoid this place!
